01.how javascript code runs in browser?
The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute.
 In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code,
 interprets each line, and runs it.

03.what is event loop in javascript?How it works?

The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack. ...
 The JavaScript engine places the following function call on the callback queue and executes it when the call stack is empty.
 In other words, the JavaScript engine executes it after the console.
The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.
 If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, 
which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
